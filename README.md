In January, I completed a bootcamp with Tripleten in the QA Engineer field, and since then, I have been committed to pursuing a career in this field.  I led two projects in a hackathon, which both of them emerged as the winning project. During those hackathon project, I gained more experience in manual testing, test documentation, positive and negative test cases. The test cases were developed using BDD, with detailed bug reports. Additionally, the Shift Left methodology was employed, emphasizing collaboration and communication.

My profile is also on Crowdtest, where I conducted tests for the Trela application, including exploratory testing, and now I am freelancing as a tester for the Petz application. I also participated in Tachyonix's Testing Academy, where I was introduced to SAP...

Overall, I am always eager to learn. I am a Tester with limited professional experience but with sufficient knowledge to apply in practice. I speak English; I studied English for 6 years at a public language institution in Brasília, which I consider one of the best schools for learning foreign languages. I also studied French for 4 years at the same institution.

I am excited to grow in this field and apply everything I have learned. If you'd like to exchange experiences, feel free to reach out!
