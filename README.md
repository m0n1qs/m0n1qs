I've spent almost my entire life working in sales, and now I'm a recent graduate in Quality Assurance from Tripleten. Not that I've completely abandoned the sales field; on the contrary, sales itself remains extremely strong and present in my daily life. I believe everything revolves around "selling," much like my presentation now. I'm excited to grow in this field and apply everything I've learned. My goal is to contribute to challenging projects while continuing to learn from experienced professionals!
